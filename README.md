# Network-Effects-of-Death

This notebook contains my research into how death of an individual affects rest of society.

I do not take a analytics approach in this notebook. The goal is to come up with a set of equations that help model grief in both spatial and temporal dimensions of a graph which represents the society or "system" in this context. I am trying to how much time it takes for the system to reach an equilibrium state.

If you are interested in analytic reasearch, there already are good papers out there. No I am not going to paste the links here, google them, lol.
